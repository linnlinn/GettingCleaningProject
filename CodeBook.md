# Subject
First variable is the index of the test subjects (30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years).

# Activity_name
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

# All the rest
Each column contains the means by test subject and activity of different data from the initial dataset corresponding to means and standard deviations of mesurements with the accelerometre of Samsung Galaxy SII.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
